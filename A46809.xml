      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But ſo far was I from refuſing conference with them, that I entertained neare two houres diſcourſe with them at that time, though I had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twice that Sabboth, my body being thereby very faint and weary; expreſſing alſo the greateſt forwardneſſe and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to informe and ſatisfie them whenſoever they pleaſed, and deſiring them to that end to come to my houſe, for indeed I much pittied them. To be ſhort, it wat at length propounded by one of my friends, that my ſelf and two Miniſters might diſpute with three of theirs who were of a contrary judgement concerning the points in controverſie, for the ſatisfaction of the unſetled Gentlemen. This motion I embraced moſt willingly, and deſired them to certifie ſo much to their <hi>Miniſters,</hi> which they promiſed to do; and upon advice taken with ſome reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend brethren concerning the fitteſt and profitableſt manner of managing the ſaid diſputation, I made this offer under my hand in writing, and ſent it by ſome of the unſetled Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>viz.</hi> That I would ſend their Miniſters the heads of all my Sermons, with all thoſe poſitions contained in them, that oppoſed the way of ſeparation; and if they would ingage to anſwer them in print, I promiſed alſo to publiſh a reply in print
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65217:11"/>to that their anſwer, that ſo all the world might ſee on which fide the truth lay. But this offer, ſavouring too much of plaine dealing, and love of the light, their Minihers accepted not, pretending their mighty imployments. The Miniſters refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the diſcuſſion of the controverſie by way of writing, though ſolicited thereto by my Letter, what followed: why now my Gentlemen (to make up in ſobriety what they wanted in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledneſſe) having it ſeems leiſure enough, earneſtly deſire that I would engage with them in writing. This I refuſed, holding my ſelf cloſe to my former offers, that if any of them were unſatisfied, I would endeavour moſt willingly in a private way of conference to inform them, conceiving that this might content them who aimed at information and not at oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In this relation therefore of Mr. <hi>Goodwins,</hi> I charge him with theſe two broad faced falſities: 1. His ſaying, That I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed conference with his followers, whereas I earneſtly invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to come to me for that end. 2. His ſaying, That I was adviſed by my brethren to diſpute with his followers only by writing, whereas I never was adviſed or offered at all to diſpute with <hi>them</hi> by writing; my offer to diſpute by writing or printing, being onely made to their <hi>Miniſters,</hi> or thoſe ſo called.</p>

                           <p>If beleeving be no <hi>foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> why doth the Apoſtle give to <hi>faith</hi> the name of foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Not laying againe the foundation of repentance and of faith, &amp;c.

                           <p>Suppoſe you had in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth page written the truth, therefore ought you not to be blamed for writing errours in the 18. <hi>pag.</hi> 21. <hi>Bu. Buſh.</hi>

                           <p>At your command I ſhall conſult the pages, wherein you would be thought to ſay, The Scriptures are the word of God. In theſe pages, and pa. 17, you ſay, That you <hi>grant the matter and ſubſtance of the Scriptures, the gracious counſels of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to be the Word of God. As that Chriſt is God and man, that he dyed, that he roſe againe, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe you ſay are onely the word of God, and not <hi>the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings or written word;</hi> when you ſay the <hi>matters, &amp;c.</hi> are the <hi>Word of God,</hi> you ſuppoſe they ſhould be <hi>beleeved</hi> for ſuch.

               <p>Nor is the queſtion whether <hi>ink and paper</hi> be the foundation; <hi>a conceit ſo ſenceleſſe,</hi> that it would never have come into the head of any man but Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> and ſuch as are left of God to blaſpheme; <hi>inke and paper</hi> being the externall <hi>matter</hi> of any writings whatſoever, as well as the holy <hi>Scriptures.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In direct oppoſition to which deteſtable paſſage, I aſſert that by Scriptures or foundation of faith, we are not onely to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the <hi>gracious counſels,</hi> or their <hi>materia circa quam,</hi> as <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus</hi> ſpeaks, the <hi>doctrines</hi> of ſalvation, but their <hi>form</hi> alſo, or the <hi>ſignification from God of theſe Doctrines in the written Word, or in letters, or writing.</hi>

If it he impoſſible</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to beleeve that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Scriptures is the Word of God, if I be uncertaine whether the written Word be the Word of God or no; how came the Patriarchs who lived in the firſt two thouſand yeares of the world to beleeve it, ſince it was uncertaine to them, whether ſuch a word ſhould ever be written.</hi> Here's more oppoſed than ink &amp; paper, <hi>viz.</hi> the written Word.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now examine his arguments, having briefly premiſed theſe following conſiderations, for the further explaining of the queſtion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The end of mans creation was to glorifie God, and to ſave his owne ſoule.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. <hi>When the Church was further extended, more increaſed, and to be ſet as a City upon an hill, and when impiety abounded in mens lives, God commanded this his will formerly revealed to be ſet downe in writing.</hi>

               <p n="1">1 You ſay, <hi>I am ridiculous in making an oppoſition betweene opening of mens eyes, and bringing light to them who have eyes already, as if men who had eyes to be opened had not (yet) eyes already.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Moſt fulſome! In Scripture Phraſe <hi>to open the eyes</hi> is to give <hi>ſight,</hi> and not <hi>light only.</hi> In <hi>Job.</hi> 9.10.11.21.26.30. the blinde man is ſaid to have had his <hi>eyes opened,</hi> what's that if not that he had <hi>ſight</hi> beſtowed upon him? not (according to Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi>) that he had light only brought to him <hi>having good eyes already.</hi> His eyes are ſaid to be opened, though he were borne blinde.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Thus you proceed; <hi>The Scripture by the opening of the eyes of men in converſion, meane only ſuch an opening as is proper for the light to effect, for as darknes ſhuts mens eyes, and the light of the morning opens mens eyes.</hi> So here,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this be ſo, what is the worke of grace upon <hi>the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding?</hi> The light irradiats or cleares the <hi>medium,</hi> but gives no <hi>ſtrength</hi> to the <hi>organ;</hi> ſo (ſay you) 'tis in <hi>converſion,</hi> a <hi>naturall man</hi> hath <hi>good eyes</hi> already, let the <hi>object</hi> be but clearly propoſed, and he can ſee it; is not this <hi>pure Pelagianiſm,</hi> to place grace in the <hi>giving of the Word?</hi> But know according to Scripture, a naturall man wants <hi>ſight</hi> as well as <hi>light,</hi> Deut. 29.4 <hi>the Lord hath not given you a heart toperceive, nor eyes to ſee; open mine eyes</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. and <hi>Eſ.</hi> 42.7. Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>open the blinde eyes,</hi> Pro. 20.12. <hi>The hearing eare, and ſeeing eye are made
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65217:50"/>by God.</hi> And 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.20. <hi>He hath given us an underſtanding to know him.</hi> And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, not that <hi>we were in</hi> the <hi>darke,</hi> but that <hi>we were darkneſſe,</hi> Eph. 5.8. you told us, Sion Col. viſit, p. <hi>that you have alwaies aſſerted the neceſſity of grace by way of adjutory;</hi> now I underſtand what grace you meane, none that conferres any power upon the faculty by which it is inabled to act, but only reſtores it to a capacity of preſent acting. But you deſire to prove your error; 1. by Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why ground you not an argument from any or all of theſe Scriptures, that by giving of <hi>ſpiritual Iſight</hi> is only meant the giving of <hi>light,</hi> as the Sun or the Morning may be ſaid to <hi>open</hi> mens <hi>eyes?</hi> Nay, why doe you not ſo much as recite the words of the text, but only ſet downe the <hi>figures</hi> of Chapters and Verſes. There's not one of them that make for your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and ſome that make directly againſt you, Mat. 4.16. <hi>The people that ſat in darkneſſe ſaw great light; Ergo quid?</hi> therefore in converſion, becauſe God gives the <hi>light by which</hi> he doth not alſo give the <hi>ſight with which</hi> we ſpiritually ſee. Doth his giving the one to this people prove that he did not alſo give the other to thoſe among them, that were ſavingly <hi>inlightned;</hi> blinde <hi>Bartimeus</hi> ſees <hi>the light</hi> when <hi>Chriſt</hi> recovers him from his <hi>blindneſſe,</hi> therefore his recovery was only effected by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the <hi>light,</hi> and not by the worke of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in beſtowing <hi>a power of ſeeing</hi> upon his <hi>eyee;</hi> ſo here the people <hi>ſaw great light,</hi> that is (according to <hi>G.</hi> the gloſmaker) they ſaw only by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>the Goſpell;</hi> for that place out of the 2 Cor. 4.4 <hi>The god of this world hath blinded the mindes of them that beleeve not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt ſhould ſhine unto them;</hi> it makes directly againſt him: 1.

                     <p>There is a ſecond thing that I would have you likewiſe to put into your Anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That I am much wronged and abuſed in what Maſter <hi>G.</hi> relates concerning the Sermon I preached <hi>Jan.</hi> 12.1644. The truth is, looking over my notes, I finde that I made two Sermons upon the Doctrine mentioned in the Booke. In which I laid downe this poſition quite contrary to his aſſertion, <hi>That man by nature is dead in ſin and treſpaſſes, unable to do any thing that is ſpiritually good, as he ought to do.</hi> That man <hi>by nature is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to believe and repent, and is like the cold earth, able of it ſelfe to bring forth briers and thornes, but not able to do any thing pleaſing to God, in order to eternall life, unleſſe he be enabled by the ſeed of grace ſorcen in his heart by Gods holy Spirit.</hi> Indeed I added,</p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:65217:64"/>
                     <p>That a man <hi>unconverted,</hi> remaining <hi>unconverted,</hi> might do that <hi>that was right in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> he might do <hi>bonum</hi> though not <hi>benè.</hi> And by the helpe of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in the common worke of it, he might do <hi>many things in order to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And that the reaſon why he is damned, is not for <hi>want of power,</hi> but for not <hi>improving the power he hath;</hi> not for <hi>cannot,</hi> but <hi>will not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But then I ſubjoyned two other poſitions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That no unconverted man <hi>did ever improve the power that God hath given him,</hi> but doth give <hi>advantage</hi> to <hi>God</hi> to <hi>damne</hi> him for <hi>voluntary refuſing</hi> to do what he hath power to do.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That though an <hi>unconverted man</hi> did <hi>improve his naturall abilities</hi> to the utmoſt of his power, yet notwithſtanding <hi>God was not bound by any promiſe to beſtow the grace of converſion upon him.</hi> This I proved by five arguments too long here to repeat.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have given you a ſhort account of what concerns me in his Booke. I have but a word more to ſay; and that is to a paſſage in the 131 page, in which he ſaith, <hi>He will not ſo far abuſe me, as to call me either learned or pious.</hi> For my part, I thanke God I am not ſolicitous what he or his Pulpit-Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſay of me.
