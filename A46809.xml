            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>TheÅ¿e and divers other reaÅ¿ons have induced me alwaies Å¿ince I knew what belonged to Divinity, to deteÅ¿t and abhorre this his unÅ¿ound and unjuÅ¿tifiable opinion.</p>
                     <p>There is a Å¿econd thing that I would have you likewiÅ¿e to put into your AnÅ¿wer.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That I am much wronged and abuÅ¿ed in what MaÅ¿ter <hi>G.</hi> relates concerning the Sermon I preached <hi>Jan.</hi> 12.1644. The truth is, looking over my notes, I finde that I made two Sermons upon the Doctrine mentioned in the Booke. In which I laid downe this poÅ¿ition quite contrary to his aÅ¿Å¿ertion, <hi>That man by nature is dead in Å¿in and treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿es, unable to do any thing that is Å¿piritually good, as he ought to do.</hi> That man <hi>by nature is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to believe and repent, and is like the cold earth, able of it Å¿elfe to bring forth briers and thornes, but not able to do any thing pleaÅ¿ing to God, in order to eternall life, unleÅ¿Å¿e he be enabled by the Å¿eed of grace Å¿orcen in his heart by Gods holy Spirit.</hi> Indeed I added,</p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:65217:64"/>
                     <p>That a man <hi>unconverted,</hi> remaining <hi>unconverted,</hi> might do that <hi>that was right in the Å¿ight of the Lord,</hi> he might do <hi>bonum</hi> though not <hi>benÃ¨.</hi> And by the helpe of the <hi>Holy GhoÅ¿t</hi> in the common worke of it, he might do <hi>many things in order to Å¿alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And that the reaÅ¿on why he is damned, is not for <hi>want of power,</hi> but for not <hi>improving the power he hath;</hi> not for <hi>cannot,</hi> but <hi>will not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But then I Å¿ubjoyned two other poÅ¿itions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That no unconverted man <hi>did ever improve the power that God hath given him,</hi> but doth give <hi>advantage</hi> to <hi>God</hi> to <hi>damne</hi> him for <hi>voluntary refuÅ¿ing</hi> to do what he hath power to do.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That though an <hi>unconverted man</hi> did <hi>improve his naturall abilities</hi> to the utmoÅ¿t of his power, yet notwithÅ¿tanding <hi>God was not bound by any promiÅ¿e to beÅ¿tow the grace of converÅ¿ion upon him.</hi> This I proved by five arguments too long here to repeat.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have given you a Å¿hort account of what concerns me in his Booke.
